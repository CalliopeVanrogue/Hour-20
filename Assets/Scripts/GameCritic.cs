public class GameCritic : MonoBehaviour
{
// The game was honestly too easy. 
//It was boring because it was just dodging and weaving. 
// Phasing through obstacles while having a cooldown made it too easy to avoid obstacles

//I would make the graphics more interesting. Like additional particle effects that appear when you hit a powerup or an obstacle.
// I would also change up speed. For instance if you hit the powerup you run faster if you hit an obstacle you run slower rather than it just be a timing thing

// The phasing made the game fun but I can honestly say I didn't enjoy anything else about the game

//The whole game was rather tedious for me. Constantly running towards or away from the obstacles was just boring there was nothing really appealing about the game.
